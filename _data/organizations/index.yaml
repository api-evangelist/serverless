    Amazon Web Services(AWS) is a collection of remote computing services (also
    called web services) that together make up a cloud computing platform,
    offered over the Internet by Amazon.com. The most central and well-known of
    these services are Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3. The service is advertised as
    providing a large computing capacity (potentially many servers) much faster
    and cheaper than building a physical server farm.

    Design, deploy, and monitor your cloud-native applications, easily.
    Applications running on serverless architectures scale up and down on demand
    with high availability. There is no need to provision or manage servers.
    Your code runs only when it's needed, and you only pay for the compute time
    you use. Stackery provides operational tools for developers building
    serverless applications. Easily detect and surface application errors,
    version control your serverless infrastructure, and securely manage
    configurations and deployments. Stackery helps developers build
    production-grade serverless applications by providing an abstraction layer
    on top of base serverless technologies like AWS Lambda. Stackery allows you
    to focus on your business logic rather than configuring infrastructure
    services.

    developer tools, such as GitHub and Stripe, offer webhooks as a way of
    delivering notifications. Webscripts are a fast and easy way to receive
    those webhooks. Our built-in request logging makes them equally easy to
    debug on-the-fly. Webscripts can also be activated on a schedule, providing
    a simple way to build monitoring or other automation.
