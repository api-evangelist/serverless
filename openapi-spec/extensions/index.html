<h1>OpenAPI Spec Extensions</h1>
<p>Additional data can be added to OpenAPI Spec to extend the specification at certain points, by prefixing any valid JSON format value with "x-". This is meant to be a list of these extensions to the specification I have found in the wild. I would like to see a master list of them available as a reference for others to follow, rather than re-inventing the wheel.</p>

<h3>{{ extension.title }} by <a href="{{ extension.source_url }}">{{ extension.name }}</a> (<a href="{{ extension.source_url }}">source</a>)</h3>

{% endfor %}

<p align="center">If you know of any OpenAPI Spec extensions not listed, please <a href="https://github.com/api-evangelist/definitions/issues">submit as issue</a>.</p>
